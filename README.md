### Code for my Raspberry Pi Dash Camera

Startup initalizes the camera.py script to allow control via the GPIO pins.

Dayman/Nightman scripts start the camera recording in either a day- or night-optimized mode.

I used python scripts to call bash scripts as I was inexperienced and could not figure out how to call bash scripts at the time.

# Enjoy!
